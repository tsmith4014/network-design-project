# System Architecture Diagram:

## Web Servers:

- Deploy multiple EC2 instances to host the WordPress application across multiple Availability Zones within a VPC for high availability.

## Load Balancer:

- Use AWS Elastic Load Balancer (preferably Application Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single point of failure.

## Database:

- For the on-premise database, establish a VPN connection between the AWS VPC and the on-premise network. Consider using AWS Direct Connect for a more reliable connection.

## Cache:

- Implement AWS ElastiCache to improve the performance of the WordPress site by caching common queries.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN):

- Utilize AWS CloudFront to cache static content closer to the users and reduce the load on the servers.

## Storage:

- Utilize Amazon S3 for storing and serving static files like images, scripts, and stylesheets.

# Network Topology Diagram:

## VPC and Subnets:

- Create a VPC with public and private subnets spread across multiple Availability Zones.

## VPN/Direct Connect:

- Establish VPN or AWS Direct Connect between AWS and on-premise network for secure database access.

## Firewall:

- Utilize AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

## Route 53:

- Utilize Amazon Route 53 for DNS management and routing traffic to the application.

# High Availability Plan:

## Load Balancing:

- Utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across servers and Availability Zones.

## Auto Scaling:

- Implement Auto Scaling Groups to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load.

## Multi-AZ Deployment:

- Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.

# Security Plan:

## IAM:

- Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources.

## WAF & Shield:

- Implement AWS WAF and AWS Shield for protection against web exploits and DDoS attacks.

## Monitoring & Alerts:

- Utilize Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail for monitoring, logging, and receiving alerts on any suspicious activities.

# Scalability Plan:

## Auto Scaling:

- Implement AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances as traffic demands change.

## Database Scaling:

- Consider replicating the on-premise database to AWS RDS or Aurora and setting up read replicas to handle increased database traffic.

# Disaster Recovery Plan:

## Backup:

- Regularly back up the EC2 instances and on-premise database to AWS S3 using AWS Backup or other backup solutions.

## Multi-Region Deployment:

- Consider deploying the application in multiple AWS regions and using Route 53 for routing traffic to ensure disaster recovery.

## Testing:

- Regularly test the recovery procedures and update the disaster recovery plan as necessary.
